Understanding the problem
The console message indicates that a POST request made to the URL https://b6a8d3c1-e838-442d-8c81-ea011035e3fb-00-2n964999y03ol.janeway.replit.dev:5000/api/tests/max-min-density/temp resulted in a 500 Internal Server Error. This error code is a generic server-side error, meaning the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request [1, 4]. It's not an issue with your client-side code's request format or headers, but rather something went wrong on the server when processing your request [2].

Looking at your code, you have a conditional statement that checks if the URL includes /api/max-min-density. However, the actual request URL in the error message is /api/tests/max-min-density/temp. This mismatch suggests that your conditional logic url.includes('/api/max-min-density') might be leading the request down the wrong path within your apiRequest function. It seems the request intended to be handled by hybridStorage.createMaxMinDensityTest is instead falling through to the fetch call to the external API, which then returns the 500 error.

How to verify
Inspect the Network tab: In Chrome DevTools, go to the "Network" tab and find the failed POST request to /api/tests/max-min-density/temp.
Check the Request URL: Confirm the exact URL being sent.
Inspect the code execution: Set a breakpoint in your apiRequest function at the beginning of the function and step through the code when the failing request is made. Observe which branch of the if statement is being executed.
Suggested fix
Adjust the conditional statement in your apiRequest function to accurately match the intended API endpoint for creating the max-min density test. It seems the correct path includes /api/tests/max-min-density.

Code

if (method === 'POST' && url.includes('/api/tests/max-min-density')) { // Changed condition here
    const result = await hybridStorage.createMaxMinDensityTest(data as any);
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(result), { status: 200 });
  }

  // For all other API calls (users, organizations, etc.), use direct server API
  const res = await fetch(url, {
    method,
    headers: data ? { "Content-Type": "application/json" } : {},
    body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,
    credentials: "include",
  });

  await throwIfResNotOk(res);
  return res;
Use code snippets with caution

By changing the condition to check for /api/tests/max-min-density, the POST request to /api/tests/max-min-density/temp should now be handled by your hybridStorage logic instead of being forwarded to the external API.

Summary
A 500 Internal Server Error on a POST request indicates a problem on the server processing the request. In this case, the client-side code was likely sending the request to the wrong handler due to an incorrect URL check in a conditional statement, causing it to be forwarded to an external API that returned the error. The fix involves updating the conditional logic to correctly route the request to the intended internal handler.
