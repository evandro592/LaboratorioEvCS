Explanation

Understanding the problem
The console error GET ... 401 (Unauthorized) indicates that the server rejected the request because it lacked valid authentication credentials [1, 3]. This means that the server understood the request, but it requires some form of authentication (like a username/password, API key, or token) that was not provided or was incorrect in the request [2, 4]. The server is telling the client that it doesn't have permission to access the requested resource (/api/tests/real-density) without proper authentication [3].

The fetch request in your code includes credentials: "include". This tells the browser to include cookies, authorization headers, or TLS client certificates if they are associated with the origin of the requested URL. While this is necessary for some authentication methods, simply including credentials doesn't guarantee that the correct or sufficient credentials are being sent for this specific endpoint [2].

How to verify
You can verify this by trying to access the same endpoint directly in your browser or using a tool like Postman. If you receive a 401 Unauthorized response in those cases as well, it confirms that the issue is with the authentication required by the server for that specific endpoint. You would also likely see a WWW-Authenticate header in the response headers, which specifies the type of authentication required by the server [3].

Suggested fix
The fix requires providing the necessary authentication credentials with the request. The exact method depends on how the server is configured to handle authentication for the /api/tests/real-density endpoint. Common methods include:

Bearer Token: Include an Authorization header with a token (e.g., Authorization: Bearer your_token).
API Key: Include an API key in a header or as a query parameter, as required by the API.
Basic Authentication: Include an Authorization header with a base64 encoded username and password (e.g., Authorization: Basic base64_credentials).
Based on the provided information, it's impossible to determine the exact authentication method required. You will need to consult the API documentation or the server-side code to understand what type of authentication is expected for the /api/tests/real-density endpoint.

Once you know the required authentication method, modify your fetch request to include the appropriate headers or parameters.

For example, if the API uses a Bearer token stored in a variable authToken:

Code

// For all other API calls (users, organizations, etc.), use direct server API
  const headers: HeadersInit = data ? { "Content-Type": "application/json" } : {};
  if (authToken) { // Assuming authToken holds your bearer token
    headers["Authorization"] = `Bearer ${authToken}`;
  }

  const res = await fetch(url, {
    method,
    headers,
    body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,
    credentials: "include",
  });

  await throwIfResNotOk(res);
  return res;
Use code snippets with caution

Replace authToken with the actual variable or method you use to obtain the necessary authentication credential.

Summary
The 401 Unauthorized error means the server requires authentication to access the requested resource. To fix this, you need to provide the correct authentication credentials (like a token, API key, or username/password) in your fetch request, according to the server's requirements. Consult the API documentation to determine the expected authentication method.
