Explanation

Understanding the problem
The console error POST https://.../api/tests/max-min-density 401 (Unauthorized) indicates that the server rejected your POST request because it requires authentication credentials that were either missing, incorrect, or insufficient. The server understands the request but won't fulfill it without successful authentication [1, 2].

How to verify
Check if the /api/tests/max-min-density endpoint on your server requires authentication. You can do this by consulting your server-side code or API documentation.
Verify that your client-side code is sending the necessary authentication credentials with the request. This could involve checking for the presence of an Authorization header with a valid token or other required authentication methods [1, 2].
Suggested fix
Based on the provided code snippet, you are making an API call using fetch. While you are including credentials: "include", this primarily handles cookies. If your API requires a token (like a Bearer token) or other header-based authentication, you need to explicitly add an Authorization header.

Modify your fetch call to include an Authorization header with the appropriate token. Replace "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" with the actual token you need to send.

Code

// For all other API calls (users, organizations, etc.), use direct server API
  const res = await fetch(url, {
    method,
    headers: data
      ? {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
          "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" // Add this line
        }
      : { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" }, // Add this line
    body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,
    credentials: "include",
  });

  await throwIfResNotOk(res);
  return res;
Use code snippets with caution

If your API uses a different authentication scheme (e.g., Basic Auth, API Key), adjust the Authorization header format accordingly [1, 2].

Summary
A 401 Unauthorized error means the server requires authentication. To fix this, ensure your client-side code sends the necessary authentication credentials, such as an Authorization header with a valid token, when making the request to the protected endpoint.
