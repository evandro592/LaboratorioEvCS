density-real.tsx:165 Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.

Explanation

Understanding the problem
The warning "Maximum update depth exceeded" in React indicates that your component is entering an infinite rendering loop. This typically happens when a setState call within a useEffect hook triggers a re-render, and the useEffect hook runs again due to a dependency changing (or the absence of a dependency array), causing another setState call, and the cycle repeats indefinitely [1].

The console stack trace points to the DensityReal component and specifically to line 165, where a setState call is likely occurring within a useEffect hook.

Suggested fix
Examine the useEffect hook in your DensityReal component around line 165. Identify which state update (setState) is causing the re-render. Ensure that the dependency array of this useEffect correctly includes all the variables that the effect depends on. If a variable in the dependency array changes on every render, causing the infinite loop, you need to find a way to prevent that specific variable from changing unnecessarily or restructure your logic to avoid updating the state based on that variable within the effect.

Here's a general example of how to fix this by correctly specifying dependencies in the useEffect hook:

Code

useEffect(() => {
  // Your logic that might call setState
  // setSomeState(newValue);

}, [dependency1, dependency2]); // Include all variables used inside the effect
Use code snippets with caution

If the state update is intended to happen only once when the component mounts, provide an empty dependency array []:

Code

useEffect(() => {
  // Logic to run only on mount
  // setSomeState(initialValue);
}, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs only once on mount
Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The "Maximum update depth exceeded" warning in React is caused by an infinite re-rendering loop, often due to setState calls within useEffect that incorrectly trigger subsequent renders. To fix this, ensure your useEffect dependency array accurately reflects the variables the effect depends on, or use an empty dependency array if the effect should only run once on mount.
